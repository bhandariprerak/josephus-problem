### History and Problem Statement

In computer science and mathematics, the Josephus problem (or Josephus permutation) is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game. Such games are used to pick out a person from a group, e.g. eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

In the particular counting-out game that gives rise to the Josephus problem, a number of people are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a specified point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specified direction. After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is executed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person, going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people, until only one person remains, and is freed.

The problem can have variants using the parameters — given the number of people, starting point, direction, and number to be skipped—is to choose the position in the initial circle to avoid execution.

This repository currently solves the problem in its simplicity where input is the number of people and output is the winning position i.e, the position where the person is saved from execution.
